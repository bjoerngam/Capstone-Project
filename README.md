# Capstone-Project
Udacity Android Developer Capstone Project

# How to test
For the Udacity testing team: 
As you might notice the quality of the JSON file isnt quite well. So for the image I used always placeholders.
But hopefully the source will be better.

There are two flavours in my project for your purpose you have to 
use the devel tree. I added here three different GPS settings with them you can test three different 
positions in Cologne. The distance is 300 meters.

For the Espresso tests: You should also use the devel flavour.

# About the project 
For this project I used the following libraries and sources.For the position
of the "solpersteine" I used https://openstreetmaps.org/ and for getting the proper
JSON objects out of this map I used https://overpass-turbo.eu/ <p>For the whole HTTPS traffic issue I used
the OKHTTP3 https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/okhttp/src/main/java/okhttp3. <p>For parsing the JSON
objects I used GSON https://github.com/google/gson. For creating the nice info slides
I used Android Material Intro Screen https://github.com/TangoAgency/material-intro-screen.<p>
For the GPS matching approach I used the blog of Krzysztof Jackowski
https://www.netguru.co/blog/augmented-reality-mobile-android For displaying the images I used
the Picasso library https://square.github.io/picasso/ and for getting ride of some line of
codes I am using the butterknife https://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/<p>
The whole project is an open source project and you can get the source code at
https://github.com/bjoerngam/ If you have any kind of questions contact me via devel@bjoern.cologne
